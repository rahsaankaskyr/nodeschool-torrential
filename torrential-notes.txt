 Exercise 2 of 6

Now you have torrent installed lets create a torrent file that describes some content.

In your current directory execute the command 

    $ mkdir xyz; echo beep > xyz/a.txt; echo boop > xyz/b.txt

This will create two sample files a.txt and b.txt.
With test text in them. 

Now we will create a torrent out of that sample content 

    torrent create xyz/ -o xyz.torrent
